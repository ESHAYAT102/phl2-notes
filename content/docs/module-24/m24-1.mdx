## Installing and setting up Better Auth.

### Install `better-auth` with bun

Run this in the terminal:

```bash title="terminal"
bun add better-auth
```

### Environment Variables

Add these in the `.env` file:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=a_secret_code
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Base URL of your app
```

### Creating the `auth.ts` file

Create a file named `auth.ts` in one of these locations:

`lib/` directory
`utils/` directory

### Prisma Setup

Paste this code in the auth.ts file:

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
// If your Prisma file is located elsewhere, you can change the path
import { PrismaClient } from "@/generated/prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
    provider: "postgresql",
  }),
});
```

It uses Prisma with PostgreSQL.

### Prisma Schema Generation

```bash
bunx @better-auth/cli generate
```

#### Prisma Schema Migration

```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev
```
