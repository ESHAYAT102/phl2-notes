# Optional Type

Use a question mark after the type declaration for telling TypeScript that this value can be optional.

```ts
const user: {
  firstName: string;
  middleName?: string; // [!code highlight]
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
} = {
  firstName: "Eshayat",
  lastName: "Al-Wasiu",
  age: 16,
};
```

If we pass a value instead of the type the value will not be reassignable, it's called literal.
We can also disable reassigning by adding `readonly` before the type.
