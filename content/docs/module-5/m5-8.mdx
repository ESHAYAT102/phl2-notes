description: Rest & Spread Operator
---

# Spread operator

If we push an array into another we'll get error if the other array doesn't allow nested arrays/type. To do that, we can simply spread the array, it won't give any errors.

Example code:

```ts
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

const moreColors = ["pink", "indigo", "purple"];

colors.push(...moreColors);

console.log(colors);
```

# Rest operator

Rest operator is the exact opposite of spread operator. They pick things up from different places and put in one set.

Example code:

```ts
const addFruit = (...fruits: string[]) => { // [!code highlight]
  fruits.forEach((fruit) => {
    console.log(fruit);
  });
};

addFruit("apple", "mango", "banana"); // [!code highlight]
```
