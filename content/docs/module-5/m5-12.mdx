description: ternary, nullish coalescing & optional chaining

# Question mark

- `?!` - ternary operator
- `??` - nullish operator
- `?.` - optional chaining

Example of ternary operator:

```ts
const isAdult = (age: number) => age < 18 ? "you are not an adult" : "you are an adult";
```

Example of nullish operator

```ts
let userTheme;

const selectedTheme = userTheme ?? "Dark Default";

console.log(selectedTheme);
```

As the value of `userTheme` is nullish, the output will be "Dark Mode". If the user has a specific theme enabled then the output would be their theme. e.g. `Tokyo Night Theme`

Example of optional chaining:

```ts
const user: {
  name: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName?: string;
  };
  age: number;
  location: { country: string; city: string; state?: string };
} = {
  name: { firstName: "Eshayat", lastName: "Al-Wasiu" },
  age: 16,
  location: { country: "Bangladesh", city: "Banasree" },
};

console.log(`${user.name.firstName} lives in ${user.location.state ?? user.location.city}`);
```

The `lastName` and `state` is optional here so TypeScript won't show error if the element doesn't exist. But the main thing is when we're accessing it, we must use a `?` after it, if we don't then our app might crash. The error is managed in this code, so it won't crash.
