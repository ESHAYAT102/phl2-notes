description: Union & intersection types
---

# Union

Union means either this or that, basically the or pipe `|`.

Example:

```ts
type roles = "admin" | "user";
```

# Intersection

Intersections are like unions, the symbol is `&`.

```ts
type Employee = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phoneNo: string;
};

type Manager = {
  designationg: string;
  teamSize: number;
};

type EmployeeManager = Employee & Manager;

const ChowdhuryShaheb: EmployeeManager = {
  id: "idCard",
  name: "Chowdhury Shaheb",
  phoneNo: "0198765432",
  designationg: "manager",
  teamSize: 20,
};

console.log(ChowdhuryShaheb);
```
