description: Install and run typescript

Run TypeScript code with NodeJS with 'node [file].ts'. It's not running it natively, it's just removing all the types and converting it into vanilla JavaScript.

Before version 22, NodeJS couldn't run TypeScript files like that.
It required a flag `--experimental-strip-types`

Use `tsc --init` to create a base tsconfig file.
In the `target` in the tsconfig file the targetted version of `es` can be declared.
