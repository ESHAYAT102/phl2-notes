description: Nullable, unknown & never type

# Nullable type

Nullable type is basically using `null` as teh type. Example:

```ts
const data: string | null = null;
```

# Unknown type

Unknown type is the same as nullable type, but just not `null` but `unknown`.
Example:

```ts
const data: unknown = 123;
```

# Void/Never

The type `never` returns nothing, which means, if the type is `never`, then the value will never be returned.
