## Type assertion

# What is type assertion

Type assertion in TypeScript is a mechanism to explicitly inform the compiler about the specific type of a value, even when TypeScript might infer a more general or less specific type. It is essentially a way of saying, "Trust me, I know more about this value's type than you do."

Example code:

```ts
let value: any = "apple";

value = 3;
```

This code won't return any erro because we declared the type to be `any`, it's basically the default behavior of JavaScript.

If we return a value from a function like this:

```ts
const func = (input: number): number | undefined => {
  return input * input;
};
```

We can use the word `as` to define that the type is this not anything else, basically telling the compiler that "Bro, I know better than you".

```ts
const result = func(2) as boolean;
```
