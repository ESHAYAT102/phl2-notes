description: Two Sum

# The concept

Two sum basically means a number and an array will be given and we'll have to add 2 with any other number in the the array and make sure the answer is equal to the output number.

## Creation

Doing this with a for loop would be very easy but it will not be much efficient. So we'll create it with a Map.

```js
const twoSum = (arr, target) => {
  const numMap = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++) {
    const currentNumber = arr[i];
    const compliment = target - currentNumber;

    if (numMap.has(compliment)) {
      return [numMap.get(compliment), i];
    }

    numMap.set(currentNumber, i);
  }
};
```

## Usage

```js
console.log(twoSum([2, 11, 7, 15], 9));
```

## Output

```js
[0, 2];
```

Because the indices that needs to be added to equal to 9 are 0 and 2.
