# Insertion sort VS Selection sort

Insertion sort is adaptive and selection sort isn't.

they both are O(n). Though for the best case scenario (already sorted array), insertion sort is better.
Because selection sort will still go through the whole array and sort it agai (the array woll not have any changes).
But insertion sort will not operate if the array is already sorted.
