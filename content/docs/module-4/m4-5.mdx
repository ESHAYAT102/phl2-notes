# What is palindrome

Palindrome means a word that stays the same when its characters are in reverse.

## Creation

Basic code:

```js
const isPalindrome = (str) => {
  const normalized = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "");

  const reversed = normalized.split("").reverse().join();

  if (reversed === normalized) {
    return true;
  }

  return false;
};
```

This is the easiest approach. Let's see a more advanced approach.

Advanced code:

```js
const isPalindrome = (str) => {
  const normalized = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "");

  let left = 0;
  let right = normalized.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    if (normalized[left] !== normalized[right]) {
      return false;
    }

    left++;
    right--;
  }

  return true;
};
```

This one is a two pointer concept. two pointers start counting from two ends of the word and meet at the middle.

## Usage

```js tab="basic"
console.log(isPalindrome("level"));
console.log(isPalindrome("apple"));
```

```js tab="advanced"
console.log(isPalindrome("level"));
console.log(isPalindrome("apple"));
```

## Output

```bash tab="basic"
true
false
```

```bash tab="advanced"
true
false
```

## Why use two pointers

The two pointer approach is better than the basic implementation because it takes less space.
The two pointer method copies the array once, but the basic approach copies it twice.
Though it doesn't matter that much for small use cases because we're web developers, website space doesn't matter as much as app/software space.
