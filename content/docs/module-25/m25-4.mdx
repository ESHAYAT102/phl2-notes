description: Searching Posts by Title
---

Created a get post to search posts by their title. It uses URL query to pass the query to the API.

Example: `http://localhost:3000/posts?search=query`

A simple search function looks like this:

```ts
const getAllPosts = async (payload: { search: string | undefined }) => {
  const allPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    where: {
      title: {
        contains: payload.search as string,
        mode: "insensitive",
      },
    },
  });
  return allPosts;
};
```
