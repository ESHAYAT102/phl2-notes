description: Procedure Example 1 & 2
---

Procedure is like functions but there are a few differences:

- Procedure is executed with `call`
- Procedure doesn't return a value
- The variables needed are defined in a block named `declare`
- The code inside the procedure function should be wrapped inside `begin` and `end`, this whole thing will also be wrapped in dollar signs
- The `declare` block is defined inside the dollar signs
