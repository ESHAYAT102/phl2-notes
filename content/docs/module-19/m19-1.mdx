description: Handling NULL With COALESCE
---

Operatiors will always return NULL if used with NULL.
Example:

```sql
select * from users where email != null
```

Use this instead:

```sql
select * from users where email is not null
```

---

`COALESCE` returns the first not null value that's passed into the function.

A very useful exampe:

```sql
select name, coalesce(email, 'Not Provided') as email from users
```
