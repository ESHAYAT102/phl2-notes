description: LIMIT, OFFSET Pagination
---

Simple example of `LIMIT`:

```sql
select * from products limit 5
```

`OFFSET` basically skips the `n` number of rows from the table (OFFSET is used with LIMIT). Simple pagination example:

```sql
select * from products limit 5 offset 5 * 0
select * from products limit 5 offset 5 * 1
select * from products limit 5 offset 5 * 2
select * from products limit 5 offset 5 * 3
select * from products limit 5 offset 5 * 4
select * from products limit 5 offset 5 * 5
```
