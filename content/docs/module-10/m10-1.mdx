description: Reading Files with the fs Module

`process.version` returns the current node version on the device.
`process.platform` returns the OS.

## Reading file with `fs` (`readFile`)

`require` or `import` `fs`. Use the `readFile` method on the `fs` module. The `readFile` module mainly takes three parameters:

- directory to the file we want `fs` to read
- the encoding of the data (e.g. `utf-8`)
- a returned error if the reading fails.

## Reading file synchronously with `fs` (`readFileSync`)

`require` or `import` `fs`. Use the `readFileSync` method on the `fs` module. The `readFileSync` module mainly takes two parameters:

- directory to the file we want `fs` to read
- the encoding of the data (e.g. `utf-8`)

It's recommended to use the `fs` module in a try/catch block.
