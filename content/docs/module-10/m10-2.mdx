description: Writing and Appending Files with the fs Module
---

# Writing

`writeFile` is also async by default, just like `readFile`.

## Writing file with `fs` (`writeFile`)

`require` or `import` `fs`. Use the `writeFile` method on the `fs` module. The `writeFile` module mainly takes three parameters:

- directory to the file we want `fs` to write
- the data we want to write into the file
- a returned error if writing fails.

## Writing file synchronously with `fs` (`writeFileSync`)

`require` or `import` `fs`. Use the `writeFileSync` method on the `fs` module. The `writeFileSync` module mainly takes two parameters:

- directory to the file we want `fs` to write
- the data we want to write into the file

It's recommended to use the `fs` module in a try/catch block.

# Append

## Appending content into a file with `fs` (`append`)

`require` or `import` `fs`. Use the `appendFileSync` method on the `fs` module. The `appendFileSync` module mainly takes two parameters:

- directory to the file we want `fs` to write
- the data we want to append into the file

It's recommended to use the `fs` module in a try/catch block.

# Usage

```js title="log.js"
const fs = require("fs");

fs.writeFileSync("./logs/app.log", "Application Started\n");
console.log("File Created");

const time = new Date().toISOString();

const loginLog = `${time} user logged in\n`;
const signupLog = `${time} user signed up\n`;
const deleteLog = `${time} user deleted their account\n`;
const changePassLog = `${time} user changed their password\n`;
const removeLog = `${time} admin removed a user\n`;
const closeLog = `Application Stopped\n`;

fs.appendFileSync("./logs/app.log", loginLog);
fs.appendFileSync("./logs/app.log", signupLog);
fs.appendFileSync("./logs/app.log", deleteLog);
fs.appendFileSync("./logs/app.log", changePassLog);
fs.appendFileSync("./logs/app.log", removeLog);
fs.appendFileSync("./logs/app.log", closeLog);
```

```bash title="terminal"
➜ bun log.js
File Created
➜
```

```log title="./logs/app.log"
Application Started
