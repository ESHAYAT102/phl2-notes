# Linked list

Linked lists usually have 2 more elements along with the main data.
Each element is called a `node`.

- previous node
- main data
- next node

We can check the length of the list by checking the node with no previous node, because the first node will not have any previous node.
And the end will be the node that doesn't have any next node.
