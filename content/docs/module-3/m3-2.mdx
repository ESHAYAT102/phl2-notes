# Stateful

The best stateful approach is using a `class`. Example:

```js
class Counter {
  constructor(count) {
    this.count = count;
  }

  add(amount) {
    this.count = this.count + amount;
  }

  print() {
    console.log(this.count);
  }
}

const counter1 = new Counter(0);

counter1.add(2);
counter1.add(3);

counter1.print();

const counter2 = new Counter(10);

counter2.add(20);
counter2.add(30);

counter2.print();
```

As you can see, using a `class` can be very beneficial as it can be reused. (`counter1` and `counter2`)

This is all OOP by the way.
