# Linked list

## Types of linked lists

There are three types of linked lists:

- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list

The first node of a linked list is called `head` and the last node is called `tail`.

### Singly linked list

Nodes in singly linked lists refer to the next node, but not the previous node.

### Doubly linked list

Nodes in doubly linked lists refer to both next and previous nodes.

### Circular linked list

Circular linked list is the one where the nodes refer to only the next node but the last one doesn't stay empty, it refers to the first node.

## Creating a linked list

Creating a singly linked list is very simple:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

## Using a linked list

It's very simple using a linked list:

```js
const head = new Node("apple");

head.next = new Node("mango");

head.next.next = new Node("banana");

console.log(head);
```

The first line creates a new node with the value "apple" in the constant variable "head", then a next node is added with the value "mango".
Just like the previous one adding another node in the "head" with `.next`, the value is "banana" for this one.
Then finally the whole list is logged.

The output would be:

```js
Node {
  value: "apple",
  next: Node {
    value: "mango",
    next: Node {
      value: "banana",
      next: null,
    },
  },
}
```

To see the output in a cleaner way, we can loop through it and log it:

```js
const head = new Node("apple");

head.next = new Node("mango");

head.next.next = new Node("banana");

console.log(head); // [!code --]

let temp = head; // [!code ++]

while (temp !== null) { // [!code ++]
  console.log(temp.value, " "); // [!code ++]
  temp = temp.next; // [!code ++]
} // [!code ++]
```

The output will be:

```bash
apple
mango
banana
```
