# Algorithms

The measurements to check if an algorithm is good or not should be:

- How much time it takes to give the output
- How much space it takes or how simple the fucntion/steps are.

# Big O notation

To find out if an algorithm is good or not we can use Big O notation. It mainly compares these perspectives:

- Time complexity (Big O notation)
- Space complexity (Not a big issue for web based programs)

The units of Big O notation:

- O(n)
- O(n²)
- O(log n)
- O(n log n)
- O(1)

## Breakdown of the basic notations

- O(n) - takes a unit of time for each element. e.g. if processing 3 indexes long data takes 6ms then 1 takes 2ms, and 10 would take 20ms. So the time increases constantly with the index.
- O(1) - if the algorithm is in this category then it's considered the best because this means that no matter how long the data is, it takes a constant time. e.g. the processing takes 2 seconds no matter if the data is 300 indexes long or 3 million.
- O(log n) - algorithms of this category basically get faster as the data grows. If the data is 6 index long and takes 200ms to process, then when the data is 7 index long the time would be half 100ms. It basically halves the time each index.
- O(n²) - this is exactly the opposite of `n log n`. The time doubles as the data grows.
