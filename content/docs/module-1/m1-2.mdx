# Data Flow

Properly planning everything out before actually starting to work is very important, because it makes the implementation easier.

Top down approach - figuring out the goal and teh implementation.
Breakdown - break the whole task into small tasks.

## Idea of critical thinking

These things must be properly planned before getting started:

- Input
- Process
- Output

Think of what you need as the output, then think of how the input would be. Then finally figure out the process step by step.

Improving process performance requires these 3 things:

- Data structure
- Algorithm
- Big O notation
