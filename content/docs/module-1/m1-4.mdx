# What is an algorithm

An algorithm is basically a well defined process to achieve a goal. If the process is not well defined then it would be a function.
So how are algorithms different compared to functions? Algorithms must have the steps well defined, kinda like a template, where you just have to input something that will be processed.
Here are the conditions of algorithms:

- Must take an input
- It must have finite amount of steps
- The steps must be well defined
- There must be an actual output

## Different algorithms

There are many algorithms to get an output. Like, there are different solutions to one problem.
Each solutions have their own advantages and disadvantages. So we must figure out how we need the output to be, if I need it really fast, then the algorithm is going to be different than the one that focuses on accuracy.
