description: Candidate Keys, Subsets & Proper Subsets Explained

#### Difference between subset and proper subset:

A = \{1,2,3}

Subsets of A = \{}, \{1}, \{2}, \{3}, \{1, 2}, \{1, 3}, \{2, 3}, \{1, 2, 3}

Proper Subsets of A = \{}, \{1}, \{2}, \{3}, \{1, 2}, \{1, 3}, \{2, 3}

#### What is a candidate key?

Candidate key is a super key whose proper subset is not a super key.
If the proper subset of a key has a super key then it's not a candidate key.
